To read about how to implement this protocol, see https://stripe.com/docs/mobile/ios#prepare-your-api .

On your backend, retrieve the Stripe customer associated with your currently logged-in user (see https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_customer ), and return the raw JSON response from the Stripe API. (For an example Ruby implementation of this API, see https://github.com/stripe/example-ios-backend/blob/master/web.rb#L40 ). Back in your iOS app, after you've called this API, deserialize your API response into an `STPCustomer` object (you can use the `STPCustomerDeserializer` class to do this). See MyAPIClient.swift in our example project to see this in action.
