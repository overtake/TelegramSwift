[Unit]
Description=PipeWire PulseAudio

# We require pipewire-pulse.socket to be active before starting the daemon, because
# while it is possible to use the service without the socket, it is not clear
# why it would be desirable.
#
# A user installing pipewire and doing `systemctl --user start pipewire-pulse`
# will not get the socket started, which might be confusing and problematic if
# the server is to be restarted later on, as the client autospawn feature
# might kick in. Also, a start of the socket unit will fail, adding to the
# confusion.
#
# After=pipewire-pulse.socket is not needed, as it is already implicit in the
# socket-service relationship, see systemd.socket(5).
