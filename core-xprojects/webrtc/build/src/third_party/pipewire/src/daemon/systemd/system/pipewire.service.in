[Unit]
Description=Multimedia Service

# We require pipewire.socket to be active before starting the daemon, because
# while it is possible to use the service without the socket, it is not clear
# why it would be desirable.
#
# Installing pipewire and doing `systemctl start pipewire` will not get the
# socket started, which might be confusing and problematic if the server is to
# be restarted later on, as the client autospawn feature might kick in. Also, a
# start of the socket unit will fail, adding to the confusion.
#
# After=pipewire.socket is not needed, as it is already implicit in the
# socket-service relationship, see systemd.socket(5).
