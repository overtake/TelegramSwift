PipeWire 0.3.27

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Fix bug that caused bluetooth devices to stop working.
  - Fix session-manager crash when switching users caused by
    the DBus plugin cleanup errors.
  - Improve volume handling of monitor ports.
  - Fix GStreamer v4l2 support.
  - Implement module-remap-sink and module-remap-source in
    pipewire-pulse.
  - More fixes and improvements.


- PipeWire
  - Move the loopback code into a module. Use this in pw-loopback
    and pipewire-pulse. Fix some cleanup crashes.
  - A dummy echo-cancel module was added. Later versions will
    include the webrtc echo-canceler.
  - State files don't have the X permission anymore.
  - Move i18n core into a private header file.
  - Stream can now advertize properties and receive property
    updates.
  - Fix an issue where the wrong index was used to address a port.
    It caused Bluetooth devices to stop working.

- SPA plugins
  - Only do LFE filtering on channels we created.
  - Improve name and description of devices.
  - Improve cleanup in DBus connections and sources to avoid crash
    when destroying.
  - Improved volume handling. Hardware, Software and Monitor
    volumes are now properly separated and handled.
  - Support for S8 and S8P formats was added.

- Tools
  - pw-cli can now also create Struct from JSON arrays.

- Session-manager
  - The session manager can now also create passive links. This
    makes is possible to suspend effect chains together with the
    sinks when not in use.
  - Match rules now check the complete property value instead of
    only the start.
  - Handle multiple pending param enumerations, take only last
    result. This fixes some volume update issues.

- GStreamer plugins
  - GStreamer plugins now advertize handling DMABUF explicitly. This
    is currently the only way to avoid a memcpy for v4l2 devices.

- Device support
  - sync ACP with pulseaudio, merge upstream patch instead of our
    hack to workaround missing duplex devices.
  - V4l2 devices don't expose their fd anymore. Previously the fd
    and mmap offsets were passed to the client to access the buffer
    memory but that could create security issues.

- Bluetooth
  - Don't unregister the profiles on shutdown because this can cause
    delay, just close the dbus connection.
  - Bluetooth devices now try to use the global samplerate from the
    graph.

- PulseAudio server
  - Implement remap-sink and remap-source modules using the
    new loopback module.

    playback, causing repeating sound.
  - Profile and route switching was improved and should mimic
    more what pulseaudio did.
  - Various fixes for xruns in capture and playback.
  - Bluetooth now supports delay adjustment and various other
    improvements.
  - The pulseaudio server now correctly identifies AC3 and DTS
    streams and returns a not supported error instead of playing
    static.

    the channel mixer. Channels should now play on the right
    speakers in all cases.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Small fixes and improvements in JSON parsing and encoding.

    to, for example, control the resampler, mixer and latency.
  - Add sandboxing to the systemd services
  - Various FreeBSD fixes.
  - Improve draining and a way to exit the drain state as well.
  - Many multichannel fixes. Channel remapping should now be
    correct.
  - Fix bug with repeating audio at the end of playback because
    the drain in the resampler was not draining all channels.
  - RTKit default rt.prio has been increased to 88. This will
    likely still be clamped to 20 until distros increase the
    max priority.

- Session-manager
  - Don't try to switch to Pro Audio profile, this should be
    a user choice only.
  - Don't crash when metadata was disabled such as when not
    using the audio features of pipewire.

    pactl completion works on them.

- Device support
  - Fix ALSA format enumeration in more cases. Use the channels
    and rate as a filter.
  - Make sure the graph doesn't ever use buffers larger than
    the alsa device buffer size or we get xruns.
  - Tuning of the alsa device timeout handling and dynamic
    resampler. There should now not be any xruns when streams
    appear and disappear or when the quantum changes.
  - Fix bug in alsa device when reassigning to a new driver,
    in some cases the dynamic resampler was not activated and
    things would drift out of sync and fail.
  - Fixes in quantum changes for ALSA capture and how the
    resampler is drained and fed with the new samples.

  - Move some of the configurable parameters to the config file.
  - Fix a fatal use after free when playing samples
  - Improve module handling. loaded modules now show up in the
    list of modules and can be unloaded. This also prepares the
    core for more module implementations later.

- JACK
  - Add a config option to shorten and filter client names
  - Increase the length of the client name size and make sure
    we don't exceed the allocated size.
  - We now include our own jack header files so we can build
    without depending on another jack-devel package. We don't
    yet install the headers or provide pkgconfig files.


PipeWire 0.3.22

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Per client config files replace the module-profiles. It's
    now possible to tweak settings and load custom modules.

    maximum number of channels and no mixer controls. This is
    the usual setup for managing high end Pro Audio cards.
  - Many fixes and improvements in the JACK library to make
    devices look and integrate better.
  - Many bluetooth improvements. Playback should be more
    reliable and better synchronized. Support for the HFP HF
    profile.

    be removed from the cache.
  - Remove mlock warnings by default. There is an option to enable
    them again if you want to check if your system is optimized.
  - Remove LimitMEMLOCK lines from the service files. They can
    only lower the system settings and are thus not useful.
  - Implement per-client config files. Each pipewire client will
    now read a config file that you can use to configure the
    context of the client.
  - Implement state and config load/save in pipewire. This is used
    by the session manager or other apps.

    the session manager. This means that Flatpak pulseaudio apps
    will now run with reduced permissions.

- ALSA plugin
  - Reduce min buffer size in the plugin for lower possible
    latency.

- JACK
  - implement some missing methods to make qjackctl work again.
  - Use the context data thread instead of making our own. This
    fixes the issue where the data thread was not given RT
    priority correctly.
  - Pass extra jack flags around in port properties. This makes
    CV ports in carla work.
  - Many tweaks to the port names and aliases. Unwanted characters
    are filtered out, giving better names to jack apps. Default
    device names are now equal to those seen in pulseaudio apps.
  - Add an option to make a separate client for the monitor ports
    of a device. This makes it more usable in apps.
  - add support for system:playback_N and system:capture_N port
    names for apps that hardcode these port names.

  - Reduce the amount of events the ALSA plugins emit by bundling
    them.

- PulseAudio server
  - Implement the suspend command
  - Fixes volume in sample info

    to non-standard multichannel devices. Previously channels
    would get swapped.
  - port, node and device params are now cached in the server.
    This avoids opening and closing devices whenever some client
    enumerates formats, which improves performance a lot,
    especially in cases where opening a device is slow.
  - Add a command to keep a device open during negotiation. This
    is used to enumerate and set a format while opening the
    device just once, improving performance.
  - The null-sink scheduling was fixed.
  - A memory corruption bug was fixed in format conversion, this
    could cause crashes, silent channels or other undefined
    behaviour.
  - There is now a simple JSON parser.

- Session-manager
  - Settings files are now stored in JSON. With the json parser
    this is easier to parse and extend

- Device support
  - Bluetooth now supports additional codecs: LDAC, AptX and
    AptX HD. LDAC is known to not work very well yet.
  - ALSA devices will now default to the max supported channels
    if nothing else is specified. This makes it possible to use
    8+ channel cards with the alsa-pcm module, which is not
    supported with the default alsa-acp module.
  - Enable mSBC support in oFono.
  - Add an option to disable hardware mixers
  - ALSA now improves support for batch devices.
  - The udev rules had references to Pulseaudio removed in order
    to not create conflicts.
  - Fix a potential crash in bluetooth devices when
    disconnecting.
  - UCM cards now use HW volume when possible.

- PulseAudio server
  - The id can now be used as the name to locate cards and
    devices
  - Report streams with planar formats as well
  - Better error reporting when stream create fails
  - module-null-sink can now handle channels, rate and
    channel_map properties
  - Add support for 3 types of virtual devices: source,
    sink and duplex.
  - set-port was fixed
  - Some buffer parameters were tweaked to improve
    performance, compatibility and stuttering with lower
    latency.
  - NULL can be used as a name for the device sink/source
  - Support lookup of monitor names
  - Set properties more like pulseaudio so that some
    clients (Teamspeak) don't crash anymore

PipeWire 0.3.17

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Fix crasher bug for kwin when screensharing stopped.
  - Massive improvements and compatibility fixes in the
    PulseAudio server.
  - The session manager now has a config directory in
    /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/ It will look for files there
    to activate session manager modules. Packagers can use
    this to only activate the audio modules when the PulseAudio
    server, libjack.so or the alsa modules are installed.

- PipeWire improvements
  - We now clear hooks before adding them. Some application
    did not clear them and had random data for the destroy
    callback.
  - Return -ENOENT from unknown resources so apps can handle
    this better. It's a common problem when an app tries to
    introspect and object but it disappeared before the message
    reached the server. Apps should ignore this.
  - channelmap information is now passed with the volume
    settings.
  - DMABuf is not mmapp()ed anymore with the FLAG_MAP_BUFFERS in
    the stream or filter. This is because DMABuf usually
    requires more that just a simple mmap and is better left
    for the application.
  - increase the maximum number of ports for a client-node.
  - adapter and node-factory now support the linger option to
    keep the objects alive after the creating client disconnected.

- Device support
  - ALSA now handles error in close(), like when unplugging a
    USB device.

- Session-manager
  - The session manager is now handling DONT_RECONNECT streams
    without a target node. They get connected to a default node
    once and then fail to reconnect.
  - The session manager now exposes the stream setting as
    metadata. This makes it possible for other components, such
    as pulse-server to use this information. Information is stored
    as a json object for easier consumption.
  - The session manager now has a config directory in
    /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/ packagers can use this

- PulseAudio server
  - Pulse server now acquire the dbus name.
  - Improvements in timing and compatibility with many apps.
  - The stream-restore extension is now implemented so that
    the event volume can be configured.
  - Many stability fixes and improvements.
  - Fix some issues with module-load/unload


PipeWire 0.3.16

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - Fix screensharing for old 0.2 clients
  - Many pulse-server improvements. There is now a
    pipewire-pulse binary that is the preferred solution for
    PulseAudio compatibility. The replacement libpulse
    libraries are now deprecated. This also makes audio in
    Flatpak work.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Fix cleanup of listeners everywhere. Force remove of
    listeners in _destroy to avoid crashes.
  - Add support for a journald logger module.
  - Various memory leak fixes
  - Silence some warnings that spammed the logs.
  - Fix flush in pw_stream. This fixes small glitches when
    switching streams in music players.
  - Various FreeBSD fixes and improvements.
  - Fix some crashes when destroying objects.

- Device support
  - Reload the ALSA configuration when creating a node so that
    hotplugged devices work in all cases.
  - Fix memory leaks in ACP library. This also fixes issues
    where the mixer device was not closed.
  - Bluetooth now has support for the mSBC codec for SCO
    source and sink.

- pulse-server
  - Many introspection and compatibility improvements. It should
    now be as good or better than the replacement library.
  - Implement sample cache to make notification events work.

- JACK layer
  - handle errors when linking, fixes jack_connect hang when
    the ports were already linked.


PipeWire 0.3.15

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - This is a quick update to fix critical issues with the
    0.3.14 update, which broke screen sharing and accidentally
    enabled the experimental pulse-server.
  - Fix some compatibility issues in pulse-server with
    pavucontrol and fix an issue that would block the complete
    server.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Permission checks for new clients are now done from a
    global context, which makes it possible to assign initial
    permissions to objects.
  - Handle EINTR everywhere
  - Fix an issue with the node state changes where a quick
    pause/play would hang a client.

- Session manager improvements
  - Disable the bluez5 and pulse-bridge modules by default because
    they interfere with pulseaudio. These options should only be
    enabled if pulseaudio is removed or disabled in the system.
  - Fix an issue where the session manager could end up in
    infinite recursion while scanning for things to do.
  - The session manager will now always configure nodes to remix
    to the channel configuration of the device. This fixes the case
    where mono streams would only end up on one channel of a stereo
    device.

- Device support
  - Initial merge of A2DP extra codec support using the new bluez5
    API.

- pulse-server
  - Create the runtime directory when it doesn't exist.
  - Don't ever block the server, use non-blocking IO everywhere.
  - Fill description of profiles with the name if not otherwise set,
    this fixes a crash in pavucontrol.
  - the connection debug category will now also debug pulse
    messages.
  - Respect the no_remix flag to make the control panel channel
    check work.

- ALSA plugin
  - implement pause


PipeWire 0.3.14

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Highlights
  - This release focuses on bugfixes and stability
    improvements.
  - A new experimental pulse-server module was added. This
    module implements the pulseaudio protocol on top of
    PipeWire and can be used to make flatpaks work with
    PipeWire. It looks like this might be a better way
    forward compared to the libpulse.so replacement library.
  - A2DP bluetooth was reworked. Playback should work a lot
    better now. Support was also added to automatically link
    an A2DP source to a playback device, which makes it possible
    to use PipeWire as a bluetooth receiver as well.
  - Improvements to the routing and volume restore features
    of the session manager.


- PipeWire improvements
  - The channelmixer does not normalize volumes anymore. Volumes
    are only normalized for monitoring streams now.
  - Streams can actually start in the inactive state now.
  - The channelmixer can now also convert volume updates from one
    channel layout to another. This makes saved volumes work
    even when streams have different channel layouts.
  - Clients are only registered after the properties have been
    updated.
  - Links now have a new active state.
  - Drivers can now also specify a minimum quantum. This makes it
    possible for bluetooth devices to specify an optimum quantum
    for the given codec settings and MTU.
  - The amount of data sent over the socket was reduced by only
    sending the data that changed.
  - Client objects are now exposed after they uploaded their
    properties, which makes the new object more useful.

- Tools improvements
  - pw-cat will now add metadata to the PipeWire streams.

- Session manager improvements
  - Fix crashes when reading bad data in stored settings.
  - volume and routing is improved. Settings are now remembered
    per application or media-role.
  - The session manager remembers the last device used per stream
  - Fix a bug when moving streams where it could sometimes end
    up with linking a stream to multiple devices.
  - Use RTKit to set realtime priority on the data thread in the
    session manager. This improves performance of the pulse-server
    and bluetooth devices.
  - Add a new property to mark streams that want to capture from
    the monitor of the default sink.
  - NODE_TARGET can now also contain the node name. This avoids
    some lookups in the pulseaudio layer when selecting target
    nodes by name.
  - the -e and -d options are more usable now and can be used to
    add and remove modules from the default list of modules.

- Device support
  - v4l2: add some workarounds for buggy drivers. Add Limited
    support for droidcam.
  - ACP: improve selection of default port and profiles.
  - ACP: add support for using the hardware mixer for more than
    8 channel streams.
  - ACP: support the new port type and availability group found
    in PulseAudio.
  - A2DP bluetooth timings were reworked. Automatic linking of
    A2DP sources was added to make it possible for PipeWire to
    act as a bluetooth receiver. The code was reworked to allow
    other codecs such as APTX and LDAC in the future.
  - Try harder to recover from ALSA errors.

- GStreamer improvements
  - Fix some crashes in the monitor that cause
    gnome-initial-setup to crash.

- PulseAudio layer improvements
  - Many compatibility improvements. Improved playback in
    chrome. Fix a crash in firefox when the daemon is stopped.
  - Fix a leak in the formats.
  - Fix !ADJUST_LATENCY streams like paplay.
  - Make the device option in paplay work.
  - Fix volume/mute notifications, this makes plasma volume updates
    work again.
  - Do the conversion between PulseAudio cubic volumes and PipeWire
    linear volumes. Volume levels should behave now like they did
    with PulseAudio.

- JACK layer improvements
  - Return an error when we run out of midi events. Some application
    rely on this behaviour.

- ALSA plugin improvements
  - The ALSA plugin now also supports the node name in the
    playback_node and capture_node properties.


PipeWire 0.3.13

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- PipeWire improvements
  - Add pw-reserve tool to reserve or monitor a device on DBus.
  - Install spa-resample, a tool to resample a file.
  - Install spa-acp-tool, a tool to inspect the card profile.
  - Various fixes and improvements
  - Fix a bug in pw-stream where a capture stream could run out
    of buffers and become silent.
  - Rework the processing loops in the adapter and stream. There
    is now less latency in PulseAudio and ALSA layers.

- Session manager improvements
  - Improve the device reservation code. We now try to acquire
    the device using the dbus device reservation API before we
    probe the device. This avoids conflicts with a running
    PulseAudio where devices would disappear (because they were
    locked by the other process).
  - Don't fail on invalid input from the config files.
  - Audio devices now have the same name as what PulseAudio
    would assign.

- Device support
  - v4l2: try to use the format before enumerating the size and
    framerate. Some drivers don't check the format and might now
    work better.
  - v4l2: Fall back to MMAP when EXPBUF fails. Fix MMAP access,
    just export the fd and the mapoffset. This should make more
    devices work.
  - Fix crash in ALSA Card Profile (ACP) code.
  - ACP: fix selection of default profile. Prefer any possibly
    available profile over 'Off'. This makes some card at least
    start with something.
  - Fix soft volume. After setting the volume to 0, it would stay
    at 0 until pushed over the max volume. This should fix
    various volume related issues.

- PulseAudio layer improvements
  - Rework the buffering and latency measurements and tweak the
    buffer attributes. This should make browsers and media
    players work better. This should also improve speechd
    performance.

- JACK layer improvements
  - Fix compilation against newer JACK.


PipeWire 0.3.12

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- PipeWire improvements
  * the channelmap converter now handles unknown and strange
    channellayouts much better.
  * the resampler is now cleared correctly, avoiding clicks and
    pops at the start of sound.
  * Fixes for various crasher bugs. (paplay drain, vlc shutdown,
    pactl info, ...)
  * Fix a race condition in the node state changes that caused
    all kinds of sync and other issues (vlc, mpv, ...)
  * Improve the binary name property of applications
  * Fix the scheduling again of nodes that always need a driver
    such as the jack clients.

- Session manager improvements
  * fix routing to default nodes. Sometimes nodes were not routed to
    the default node (bluetooth)

- Device support
  * disable channelmap from ALSA by default. This is what PulseAudio
    does and thus provides better compatibility.
  * fix a bug in how the resampler was used in the ALSA source,
    causing distortion and errors when using low latency capture
    clients. (Discord, webrtc, ...)
  * Small bluetooth improvements. More work is needed for reliable
    bluetooth playback.

- GStreamer plugins
  * the device provider now stops the processing loop before shutting
    down, which avoids crashes (gnome-initial-setup).

- PulseAudio layer improvements
  * the buffer attributes were reworked to ensure compatibility with
    many more applications such as mpv and audacious.
  * the pulseaudio layer will now try hard to not hand out invalid
    channel maps to the application. (avoids crashes in
    gnome-volume-control). The channel map will now also look more
    like what PulseAudio does.
  * the @DEFAULT_SINK/SOURCE/MONITOR@ wildcards now work. This
    fixes the problem with volume keys when they are bound to
    scripts using pactl and the default sink/source wildcards.
  * the PIPEWIRE_LATENCY environment variable now works again
  * Fix some leaks of ports and port info. Also fix the leak of the
    context when the mainloop is stopped.
  * The sink/source format_info array is now filled up completely,
    this is actually not implemented yet in the real PulseAudio.

- JACK layer improvements
  * jack now returns version 3.0.0 and has PipeWire in the version
    string so that apps can report this.


PipeWire 0.3.11

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- PipeWire improvements
  * Properly cleanup the mixer structures when a port is removed,
    this should fix client crashes related to port config changes
    and other random crashes.
  * Optimize the preferred formats in the audio converter. Higher
    quality formats with higher performance are chosen first.
  * Make sure the time reported by pw_stream is always increasing,
    even when the driver and clock changes.
  * There is now also a system service and socket that can be used
    to enable PipeWire systemwide. This is however not recommended
    and disabled by default.
  * Fix channelmixer 5.1 to stereo mix matrix. It was not reading
    the conversion matrix correctly and cause channels to be
    dropped. The channelmixer will now also normalize the volume,
    like what pulseaudio does.
  * The channelmixer will now just copy channels when no layout
    has been given. It has also optimized paths for this. This
    makes it possible for apps to request > 8 channels from the
    alsa plugin (ardour).
  * Port, Node and Link will now also emit an error on the
    resources in addition to updating the error in the info. This
    would make it easier to track negotiation errors in the session
    manager later.
  * many small fixes and cleanups.
  * Fix compatibility:
	+ DOSBox: fix crash because of double free in pw_stream

- Session manager improvements
  * The session manager will now try to configure the client to
    the channel configuration of the sink/source. It will only
    do this for downmixing, never for upmixing and also never
    when the client has the dont-remix property set. It will
    also renegotiate the channel layout when moving a stream to
    a new sink/source.
  * Configuration state is now saved in XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
    Previously it was saved in $HOME/.pipewire-media-session/
    You can migrate the state by moving the files to
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pipewire-media-session (or
    $HOME/.config/pipewire-media-session as a fallback when
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set).

- Device support
  * Bluetooth sources and sinks should work better now.
  * There is now also a new bluetooth backend using hsphfpd.
  * fix the ALSA UCM Off profile for alsa pcm devices
  * improve ALSA port and profile switching. The ACP device will
    now switch to the best port and profile when availability
    changes.

- PulseAudio layer improvements
  * Implement some more callbacks. The pulse layer will now also
    notify applications of stream moved, started and latency
    changes.
  * Fix error code when an object was not found. We now return
    PA_ERR_NOENTITY instead of PA_ERR_INVALID.
  * Add some support for loading new null sinks. Applications such
    as pulseeffects use this. Note that pulseeffects does not yet
    work reliably but can start now.
  * Improve handling of profile and port updates, it should work
    much more reliable now. Apps should now also again receive
    volume updates from sinks/sources.
  * Fix compatibility:
	+ openal-soft 1.20
	+ pavucontrol (checks PA_ERR_NOENTITY)

- JACK layer improvements
  * improve default source and sink handling. It was not updated
    correctly in all cases.
  * add samplerate and period to the pw-jack wrapper to easily
    configure the desired samplerate and period for the app.

- ALSA plugin improvements
  * Add a mixer entry in the alsa config file.
  * Implement support for planar types, rework the processing
    function to make it more robust.
  * refuse to load the alsa plugin when linked against 0.2. This
    catches some old apps linked against 0.2 that want to use the
    alsa plugin.
  * Fix compatibility:
	+ linphone (ALSA SIGFPE when _status() is called
	  before _prepare()).

PipeWire 0.3.10

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Many improvements to the pulse layer.
  * GStreamer pulsesink element now works.
  * Fixes some segfaults.
  * Enable rtkit for client threads.
  * fixes capture of monitor stream by name
  * implement some more extensions, this makes paman
    work and removes some warnings.

- Many improvements to the GStreamer elements
  * negotiation rework, avoid calling GStreamer methods from
    the PipeWire callbacks because they might block and cause
    deadlocks.
  * Add support for non-string property values.
  * improve stability after buffer and format
    renegotiation.
  * Rework the device provider.
  * pipewiresink can now provide a stream that can
    be consumed by apps like cheese.

- Many improvements to the JACK layer:
  * Rework the buffer_size callbacks. Make sure we call
    the callback from a 'safe' thread and that we don't
    call the process callback while the application is
    handling the callback. This improves stability in
    apps like Carla when PipeWire dynamically changes
    the buffer size.
  * Improve compatibility with apps that call
    get_buffer_frames() with a 0 size (calfjackrack)
  * JACK can now create nodes that can be set as a
    sink/source in PulseAudio/ALSA apps (you can make an
    effects rack and set that as default sink for
    apps).

- Added a group id property for nodes. This makes it
  possible to schedule nodes with the same driver even
  when they are otherwise not linked together. To make
  this work well a new flag needed to be added to nodes
  to signal when they are ready for processing.

  Together with the GStreamer fixes, this makes things
  like:

   gst-launch-1.0 -v pipewiresrc path=51 stream-properties="props,node.group=1" !
         audio/x-raw ! pipewiresink stream-properties="props,node.group=1"

  work as expected with PipeWire managing the resampling
  to keep the clocks of the devices in sync.

  This can later also be used to force devices to be grouped
  together to create a JACK-like scheduling group.

- Streams and filter now use PIPEWIRE_NODE and
  PIPEWIRE_LATENCY env variables as fallback.

- ACP add per device port list. This makes UCM devices
  expose the right ports.

- Fix some segfaults in ACP and UCM.

- make pw-cat use the metadata to find default devices.

- The media session can now save and load audio device
  Profiles and Routes (volumes), stream volumes and
  the default sink and sources.

PipeWire 0.3.9

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Fix bad audio in chrome

- Remove some errors that are not real errors.

- Fix 100% cpu when disconnecting devices.

- Improve pulseaudio introspection of formats

- Fix JACK metadata handling, carla can now monitor the
  port it creates and insert midi.

- Add a new permission bit (M) that is needed to be able
  to configure metadata on an object. Improve security of
  metadata some more, only allow metadata on objects that
  are visible to the client setting the metadata.

- Add support for videocrop in the GStreamer elements.

- Improve handling of the runtime directory for the
  server sockets. Add some reasonable fallback when
  XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not set, as suggested in the spec.

- Improve ALSA device names from ACP.

- Fix various crasher bugs. One in the pulse layer, one in
  the session manager.

- Make alsa plugin respect the PIPEWIRE_REMOTE env variable.

- Various compile fixes.


PipeWire 0.3.8

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Fix an embarrassing crasher in the JACK layer when
  metadata keys were removed.

- Make it possible to add properties to jack clients with
  a PIPEWIRE_PROPS env variable. This can be used to make
  JACK nodes look like a device (like an effects rack).

- Improvements in the session manager in how it links
  ports. Now it will try to link matching channels first
  and be more intelligent otherwise. The session manager
  will also configure the stream to the device port
  configuration when needed.

- Add ofono backend for Bluetooth HeadSet support.

- Improve default source and sink handling. They are now
  stored with their id, instead of name, in the metadata.
  This makes it work better with JACK because of JACK's
  limited name length.

- Improve environment variables to make it possible to
  create and connect to servers other than "pipewire-0".
  Implement this in pulseaudio, JACK and alsa layers.

- Add an alsa mixer plugin so that alsamixer works with
  PipeWire. It will configure the default source/sink
  volumes.

- Fix capture devices. There was something wrong with how
  the resampler was used that caused corruption in the
  signal when the resampler was active.

- We now ship alsa card paths, profile-sets configuration
  files and udev rules so that we don't have to rely on
  the pulseaudio ones.

- Many build and stability fixes.


PipeWire 0.3.7

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Improved PulseAudio compatibility. The alsa card profile
  code was reused from PulseAudio. Devices now support
  all profiles, ports, jack detection, UCM and hardware
  mixers that PulseAudio implements. There should not
  be (almost) any difference between PipeWire and PulseAudio
  in how it presents and manages devices.
  Other missing API pieces such as the default sink/source
  and move_stream are implemented now.  At this point
  it should be possible to replace PulseAudio with the
  compatibility layer for those who want to try.

- Many fixes and improvements to the GStreamer elements.
  pipewiresrc now has the ability to periodically resend
  the last frame. This makes it possible for use-cases like
  screensharing to only update the screen on changes while
  still keeping the client side encoder busy. PipeWire
  elements can now also share a connection between them.

- Improvements to the bluetooth nodes. Dynamically adding
  and removing devices should work much smoother now. Many
  fixes and improvements to a2dp and sco nodes.

- Reduced memory usage by using less pre-allocated memory
  where possible. JACK clients are especially using less
  memory.

- Support for passive links is added again. These are links
  that don't cause the associated driver to become active.
  This makes it possible to have blocks of effects+sinks go
  to suspend as a group when not in use.

- Both consumers and producers can now ask to renegotiate
  the format. This required some cleanups and improvements
  to how links and node states were handled. More work is
  needed to implement more use cases.

- Important fixes to how memory is shared with clients. Memory
  was not correctly freed in all cases, which would result
  in reuse of the wrong memory.

- Support for planar formats for audio and video was added.

- Improved error handling in the session manager.

- Metadata is now used to manage default audio source and
  sink devices. The session manager will try to link streams
  to the default device. Changing the default device will
  move streams to the new device. PulseAudio and JACK layers
  respect the default source/sinks.

- Metadata is used to tag the desired output device for
  a stream and the session manager will move streams when
  the metadata changes. The PulseAudio layer uses this to
  implement the move_stream feature.

- Many fixes to the security modules. The session manager now
  has a flatpak module that grants permissions to flatpak
  apps. The PulseAudio layer now respects the permissions of
  objects. Security related properties are made read-only
  now. Different access modules can now coexist.

- The portal module has been split up in 2 parts:
   1) a part living in the daemon that monitors the portal
      dbus owner and tags all clients from this PID. This
      part has to run in the daemon in order to securely
      tag the clients.
   2) a part in the session manager that uses the permission
      store to manage the permissions of portal managed
      clients.


Older versions:

  can use defaults in the first case and error in the second
  case.
- Fix cleanup of proxy objects. Stability improvements on
  plug/unplug in session manager.
- Make it possible to set log level from config file
- improve debug of param negotiation errors. Log the
  parameters to stderr/journal.
- Make it possible to configure global logger
  implementation.
- Fix NEON detection

PipeWire 0.3.4

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- A quick update with some important stability fixes.


PipeWire 0.3.3

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- NEON optimizations for audio conversion (32 and 64 bits)
- rework of session manager implementation
- Add option to disable modules in the session manager
- Release midi hardware devices when suspended
- various build fixes
- Clean up options of various utils
- Stability improvements

  timings and compatibility.
- Implementation of drain and flush in pulse and alsa
  emulation.
- Implement poll on file descriptors.
- Improvement of metadata for jack emulation.
- Fix memory and thread problems in jack emulation.
- Simplification of state changes. Should make more use
  cases work in the jack emulation.
- Improvements in the gstreamer elements. Removal of
  extra internal queue. pipewiresink can now be used to
  play audio.
- Add pw-jack and pw-pulse scripts to run pulseaudio and
  jack applications with the right library path.


PipeWire 0.3.2

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- build fixes
- Added support for data type negotiation. This makes it
  possible for a client to say that it can handle DMABuf
  and MemFd and then let the server select a compatible
  format.
- Handle errors when enumerating parameters better.
- Add support for rate, format, channels and period_bytes
  to the alsa config file to restrict what alsa apps can
  negotiate.
- Fix JACK midi output.
- Optimizations in common audio format conversions using
  AVX2. Small optimizations to plugins.
- Change the vulkan compute example to an MIT licensed
  shader.
- Remove some hardcoded defaults in the audio and video
  processing and use the values from the processing
  context. This also fixes the vulkan example.
- Correct the documentation and defaults in the daemon
  config file.
- Fix alsa and v4l2 buffer recycle. A paused client could
  cause the server to leak all buffers.
- Remove some warnings that should be ignored.
- Fix a crash in the bluez5 plugins.
- Try to select higher quality formats first when
  negotiating a format with an audio device.
- Fix an infinite loop in udev detection in some cases.
- Add non-interactive mode to pw-cli. You can now just
  do "pw-cli ls Port" to get a listing of all ports.
  pw-cli will now also connect to the default server by
  default and has options to select a different server.
- Allow the server to go up to the maximum quantum (8192
  samples or ~=180ms) if a client explicitly wants this.


PipeWire 0.3.1

This is a bugfix release that is API and ABI compatible
with previous 0.3.x releases.

- Don't load the rtkit module by default. It can cause a
  sigkill, which is not desirable for mutter, for example.
  Only enable this for the jack library for now.
- Don't use pthread cancel by default because it uses a
  signal that might crash some apps. Only use it for
  the jack library because jack clients really expect this.
- Build fixes for -Werror=suggest-attribute=format
- improve error messages, don't report harmless errors and
  warnings. Try to send error messages to the proxy that
  started the operation or is the owner of the object.
- pw-cat: midi improvement, add midi recording and dump
  in verbose mode
- fix properties when loading spa-nodes from the config
- Fix and update some examples
- jack: check arguments and don't crash when invalid
- Fix buffer memory upload.
- jack: fix compatibility with zrythm. Fix timemaster
  install, improve sample_rate callback. Fix reposition
  handling.
- fix crash in port after buffer negotiation error.
- add support for control ports in pw_filter
- fix cleanup of the metadata module
- improve param enumeration.
- Clear stream buffers when the format is cleared.
- Add create-object command in the config file to create
  object from a factory.
- Fix crash after the driver was not removed from unassigned
  nodes. Also properly pause inactive nodes.
- Use "true" and "false" in properties when we are talking
  about a boolean.
- pulseaudio: improve compatibility


PipeWire 0.3.0

The 0.3 release is a major milestone in the development of
PipeWire. It features a complete redesign of the scheduling
mechanisms that make it possible to run a JACK compatibility
layer with comparable performance to JACK2.

The API has been reworked and is declared stable now. All
development files and runtime paths are versioned so that
future incompatible changes can be done without breaking
existing applications.

PipeWire 0.3 also includes a (now mandatory) session manager
that populates and controls the PipeWire graph. This example
session manager is very simple and not configurable. It is
expected that future version will either switch to a more
flexible session manager (like WirePlumber) or improve the
configuration options of the example session manager.

PipeWire 0.3 includes both PulseAudio, JACK and ALSA
compatibility libraries that are known to support a wide range
of applications. The ALSA library is pretty complete at this
point. The JACK and mostly the PulseAudio compatibility
libraries need more work. See the Wiki pages for the current
compatibility problems. We do not yet encourage people to
switch away from their existing audio solutions (PulseAudio
or JACK) but we would love to hear from people who try it
anyways. Future versions will mostly focus on improving
compatibility further to make PipeWire a drop-in replacement.

PipeWire comes with some GStreamer plugins to consume and
produce data for PipeWire. The consumer (pipewiresrc) is
working well in most cases. The sink (pipewiresink) is known
to be somewhat problematic for now.

PipeWire 0.2.97

Eighth pre-release for upcoming 0.3:

- Build fixes

- jack and pulseaudio compatibility fixes
- Fix a bug in resampler, add quality option, tweaked quality
  settings, tested now against https://src.infinitewave.ca/
  testsignals and submitted results for publication.
- Fix awkwardness in buffer negotiations, the default number of
  buffers was 4 and jack could only handle 2, causing
  corruption. Also implement negotiation of Step ranges.
- Fix device reservation to work together with pulseaudio,
  previously we would block pulseaudio.
