[**Telegram**](https://telegram.org) is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security. It’s superfast, simple, and free! This repo contains the official source code for [Telegram for macOS](https://macos.telegram.org/).

## Get it

[![Download on the Mac App Store](https://github.com/s0ph0s-2/TelegramSwift/raw/docs/better-readme/images/mas_badge.png)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telegram/id747648890?mt=12)

If you would like, you can [download the non-MAS version](https://telegram.org/dl/macos). It removes some restrictions (like banned chats), but also lacks some functionality (like the share extension and sandboxing).

You can also [download the beta version](https://telegram.org/dl/macos/beta) if you want to try the latest features and you are prepared for bugs and crashes. If you are running the beta, join the [beta testing chat on Telegram](https://t.me/macswift) to report bugs.
