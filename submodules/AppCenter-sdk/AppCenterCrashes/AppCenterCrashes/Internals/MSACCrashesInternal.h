 * debugger to not work properly: The debugger will * not stop for NSExceptions and it's impossible to handle them in a C# try-catch block.
 * On Xamarin runtime, if we don't * register our own exception handler, the Xamarin runtime will catch NSExceptions and re-throw them as
 * .Net-exceptions * which can be handled and are then reported by App Center Crashes properly. Just as a reminder: this doesn't mean * that
 * we are not using PLCrashReporter to catch crashes, it just means that we disable its ability to catch * crashes caused by NSExceptions,
