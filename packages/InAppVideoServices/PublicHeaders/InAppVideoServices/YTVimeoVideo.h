/**
`YTVimeoVideo`represents a Vimeo video. Use this class to access information about a particular video.

@see `YTVimeoExtractor` to obtain a `YTVimeoVideo` object.

@warning Do not manually initialize a `YTVimeoVideo` object. Using the `-init` method will throw an exception.

## Subclassing Notes

It is very important that you do not create a subclass of `YTVimeoVideo`

## NSObject Notes

`YTVimeoVideo` uses the `identifier` to determine the equality between two `YTVimeoVideo` objects. Calling `-isEqual:` on two `YTVimeoVideo` objects that contain the same identifiers will return `YES`, otherwise `-isEqual:` will return `NO`.
